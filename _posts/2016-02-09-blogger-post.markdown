Once again, the CloudSlang team is excited to express our appreciation for our growing open source community. Here is a brief recap of some of the contributions we've received in the past few months.


Chef - Contributed by Ben Coleman

Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework for deploying servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location. Cookbooks (and recipes) are used to tell chef-client how each node in your organization should be configured. The chef-client (which is installed on every node) does the actual configuration.

Ben's contribution contains content for bootstrapping nodes, adding/removing rules and/or recipes, and deleting nodes.

Stackato - Contributed by Nigel Wright

Stackato is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) used to deploy applications written in a wide range of languages and web frameworks, using a variety of data services. It handles the automatic configuration of the language runtime, web server, application dependencies, databases, and other services.

The content Nigel has prepared allows automation of HPE Helion Stackato (formerly ActiveState Stackato). It allows for interrogation and basic management of the environment and will be expanded to automate setup of these environments and achieve near fidelity to the application deployment functions of the CLI.

Heroko - Florian Teissedre

Heroku is a cloud platform based on a managed container system for deploying and running modern apps. 

Florian's contribution, our largest yet in terms of sheer volume (22 flows and operations!), includes content for dealing with accounts, applications, domains, regions, and more.

Google Container Engine - Contributed by Michael Bettan

Google Container Engine is a cluster manager and orchestration system for running Docker containers. It schedules containers into a cluster and manages them automatically based on user-defined requirements.

Michael, a veteran CloudSlang contributor, has contributed content for creating and dealing with clusters.

Note: This contribution has been accepted as beta content. Content contributions which require environments that are difficult to setup may be accepted as beta content. Beta content is not verified or tested by the CloudSlang team. The community is encouraged to assist in setting up testing environments for the beta content.

Keep those contribution coming!
